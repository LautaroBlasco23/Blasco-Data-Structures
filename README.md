# What's the point of this repo?

This repo is the representation of the effort I put on doing 
data structures courses and reading data structures books. With
the objective of becomming a better developer.

# folders and their meanings

* uns -> Code written for the Data Structures's university subject of the UNS.
* mocks -> Code written for some free university courses i found on the internet.
* books -> Code written based on the books i've read.

Inside of every folder it's a README file, with details about different
aspects of the implementations, interfaces, tests and books/courses practical 
exercices.
